Shock Absorber:The shock absorber dampens the motion caused by the spring’s compression and rebound, preventing the vehicle from bouncing uncontrollabl
Coil Spring:The coil spring supports the weight of the vehicle and absorbs the bumps from the road, allowing the wheel to move up and down independently.

Top Mount:The top of the strut is mounted to the vehicle’s chassis or body. It typically includes a bearing that allows the strut to rotate with the steering movement (in front-wheel-drive vehicles).
Lower Control Arm:This connects the strut to the wheel assembly. The lower control arm allows the wheel to move up and down while maintaining proper alignment and geometry.
Steering Knuckle:The steering knuckle connects to the lower end of the strut and also allows for steering movement. This is what the wheel is attached to.
